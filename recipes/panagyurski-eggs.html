<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The original recipes for this dish are from the town of Panagyurishte, as the name suggests, and are quite
    different from the modern version. The actual Panagyurishte style eggs recipe was invented in the system of
    the Balkantourist restaurants, in socialist era Bulgaria. Based on traditional Bulgarian ingredients - sirene
    and yogurt, it was given that particular name that highlights its folk origin. With time, the dish made its
    way to the average Bulgarian family's table, and with its easy preparation and great taste became a beloved
    breakfast or lunch for generations of Bulgarians.[4]  It is also worth mentioning that, in old Balkantourist era
    cookbooks, there are two variations of the dish - one where the poached eggs are placed on a bed of crumbled sirene,
    and the other where the eggs are placed on a bed of yogurt seasoned with garlic paste. With time, the two recipes have
    apparently merged, and today people mix the crumbled sirene with yogurt.</p>
